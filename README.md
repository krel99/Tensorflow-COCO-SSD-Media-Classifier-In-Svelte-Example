# TensorFlow COCO-SSD Media Classifier in Svelte

This project integrates TensorFlow's COCO-SSD model for object detection within a Svelte application. It can classify objects in real-time from a webcam stream, or browse through sample images

It should be approached as a dummy example and not a fully optimized app!

## Features

- Real-time object detection using the webcam.
- Support for object detection in static images.
- Interactive UI to switch between media sources.
- All functions are well documented!
- TODOs suggesting optimizations

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Preferably the latest stable version) or Bun.js

### Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/orcchieftain/Tensorflow-COCO-SSD-Media-Classifier-In-Svelte-Example.git` or DOWNLOAD and UNPACK
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Tensorflow-COCO-SSD-Media-Classifier-In-Svelte-Example`
3. Install dependencies `npm install` or `bun install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev` or `bun run dev`
5. Open yer browser an' go to `http://localhost:5173`, where "PORT" be the port number yer server be runnin' on.
